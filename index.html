<p style="font-size: 35px;">My name is Paul. I am a twelve year old boy born in Florida and raised in New Jersey. Over the years I have moved plenty. My first move being my most serious move at the age of two was Florida to New Jersey. For about three years I lived with my grandparents in Fair Haven, NJ and went to preschool. When I turned five me, my mom, and my stepdad moved to Parlin, Nj. Where I went to school grades K-3. After living in parlin for about 4 1/2 years my sister was starting to outgrow her cribs in my parents room. Due to this issue we needed a house with one more bed and bathrooom. During covid my grandpa bought the house I am in today, copletly "destroyed" it. Bought a crew and completly renevated everything. He pruchased and installed with his crew new wall, floors, ceilings, and rooms. Then I went to an elementary school in East Brunswick, NJ where I now live. I went to Central elementary for two years (grades 4-5). Then came middle school, my parents did not want me to go to a regualur middle school (which I did not like at the time). Thats when I got put into the lottery for Hativah International Acedemy Charter School. A different jewish school (my parents liked the jewish part). Thats where I have been for two yaers now and I am planiing to graduate from here next year when I get into 8th grade. The last grade of this school where I will then go into highschool. </p>
